These eggs are so small it is said that they can fit through the top of a needle! In the image these eggs look like clear water beads."

As a defence mechanism caterpillars exclusively eat the milkweed plant as it produces a milky toxin that is distasteful to predators. This toxin is stored in the body of the larva. At the end of all 5 stages of growth the larva is almost 2 inches in length!"

At first the chrysalis is opaque green, and becomes transparent after about 2 weeks before the butterfly is ready to emerge."
